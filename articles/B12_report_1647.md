### Analysis
Spain and Netherlands remain the best performing colonial powers. Despite some high-performing games, France appears weak with a sub-zero median VSCC%. Ajuuraan and Guarani still appear to be the weakest powers, but clusters of stronger games have inspired discussions of bi-modality. Russia and Guarani have been eliminated five times each followed by Austria and Tokugawa at 4 eliminatations.
