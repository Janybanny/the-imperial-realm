## The Trial of Pressburg

### A totally fair and unbiased summary by the PRESS TEAM (definitely not the defence attorney)

The trial lasted 3 hours.

- ["Court case" begins](https://discord.com/channels/1363651210783101198/1363977300944883885/1381984465257107457)
- ["Court case" ends](https://discord.com/channels/1363651210783101198/1363977300944883885/1382025466948616233)
- [Start of popcorn gallery (and lots of other game-talk in between)](https://discord.com/channels/1363651210783101198/1363977321920331776/1381983354991284416)
- [End of popcorn gallery](https://discord.com/channels/1363651210783101198/1363977321920331776/1382026384469397634)
- ["Defence" "lawyers" meeting start (honestly more interesting than most chats)](https://discord.com/channels/1363651210783101198/1363977121478737981/1381970051678339194)
- [Defence lawyers meeting end](https://discord.com/channels/1363651210783101198/1363977121478737981/1382024844606046289)
- [Final Verdict](https://discord.com/channels/1363651210783101198/1374086092411637781/1382024311325331496)

TL;DR if you hate law

- `@[Pressburg] Tigera of Pressburg` (HRE, Defendent) vaguely suggested moves to `@[Trieste] Ipomoeae` (HRE, witness) that could be threatening `@[Split] Duchess Umbrene` (HRE, Star Witness) - ‚Å†[#alder-hall](https://discord.com/channels/1363651210783101198/1363977300944883885/1381622543961554975)‚Å†
- They were brought on trial, with `@[Nuremberg] Emperor Tom` (Emperor of HRE, Judge) "presiding" on if Pressburg is guilty of treason to HRE
- `@[Vienna] Themperor Veqwi` (HRE) was the defence attorney with solid arguments and why this was doubtful and definitely not beyond reasonable doubt. `@[Agadez] [UrAdHere] Tim üêπ +5.5 üì∞` was the second defence attorney and was here to create chaos and have fun. `@[Trondheim] Sami | NSE | GP` was asleep
- `@[Brandenburg] annellie` was the prosecution and made reasonable arguments
- `@[Kabul] Kant: Lilium's Husband` `@[Salvador] Juror Evo üêù` and `@[Okinawa] Strategist Skurky` were the jurors and voted NOT GUILTY
- People agreed `@[Tbilisi] Richie` should DM the next trial



## Gifs of the World - Winter 1641 to Fall 1642

Here's an updated gif overview of all that happened! Thank `@[Cormantin] Emu, Cartographer ‚ú®üåµ` for all their maps!

## Fall 1642

During Fall, there were 4 Convoy commands, 23 Holds, and 97 Supports (including 24 Support-Holds).

We are still waiting on official confirmation, but **44 players died this turn** ü´° Of the 45 players who had Fall retreats to submit, only <@309563510747299841> managed to retreat into a dot. 

Notably, out of 8 powers who were retreated in Spring, 3 actually survived. Congratulations to <@624044085937963038> , <@275431850053206017> and <@241090233553256449> 

__Of the 44 deaths, 13 players were unaffiliated with alliances ( 29% )__. After alliances changes, shifts and deaths, we only have __15 alive players out of 301 without any alliance affiliation (5%)__.

The total number of alliance has shrunk, to 44 now, from the maximum of 50 during Spring.

The leading cause of this reduction is 
- **Mergers** 
- - (Kievan Rus Principality, Unholy Byzantine Empire -> Orthodox Juggernaut)
- - (United Kingdom, VikingCo, Second Hanseatic League -> The North Sea Empire)
- - (Merina Dominion, Mutapa -> Ravinala)
- **Aquisitions **(San Jorge's Accord joined Hornet's Nest)
- **Disbanding** (Spectacled Bears, Unnamed_Alliance, Heaven's Crescent, LOCK)
- **Mapmaker interference** (B1Grace and Colon Ridge)

There are 5 alliance/federations with 15 or more current members - Super Canada (26), The Hive (21), The North Sea Empire (20), Orthodox Juggernaut (20), United Nations of India (17). 

This number will often change with alliance merges/disbands and players being added/banished after Fall Retreats and Winter.

Notable alliances that were newly created in Spring or later include ARRAKIS, Baikal Besties, Hornet's Nest and The Holy Roman Thempire.

Of the dead players, 5 were from Africa, 9 from Asia, 9 from Europe, 9 from North America, and 12 from the South. Alliances that lost multiple players include Heaven's Cresent (3), Migrating Horde (3), Hornet's Nest (3), LIGMA (2), Holy Roman Empire (2), Pirates of the Caribbean (2) and Super Canada - East (2).

The alliances with the most "gains" (SCs - No. of players) are : The Hive (+6), Super Canada (+4), Pirates of the Caribbean (+3), Orthodontist Juggernaut (+3) and 7 alliances at +2.



## Winter 1642: Stats for the Stats God, Milk for the Khorne Flakes!

Welcome all, to another edition of **Stats and Sheets and Gifs and Other useful Things from Tim**.

As we don't yet have the orders log for Spring yet, here's instead some fun stats from Fall and Winter of 1642.

### Fun Stats

There were 44 players who died in 1642. Split by continent, they are:
- 5/66 = Africa = 7.5% (+1)
- 9/77 = Europe = 11.6% (-1)
- 9/71 = Asia = 12.6% (-1)
- 9/69 = North America = 13.0% (+3)
- 12/62 = The South = 19.3% (-2)
(Brackets are overall continent loss/gains)

This means that 44 players are now at 2 dots, and everyone else at 1. However, only 40 of those built, with 4 notable waives! Go Africa!
- Ayoreo had Ayoreo, Tupiniquim
- Chipaya had Chipaya, Likatanai
- Mali had Mali, Oualata
- Mandara had Mandara, Darfur

After builds (26 A, 14 F), the total number of units swing slightly in favour of Armies. We now have 178 Armies (+3) and 163 Fleets (-7) in the game.

Of the 44 players who could, only 11 chose to change names, with a list available at <#1363660497014096105> and [SirEpic's sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FJqNxfJCNstcyf-G0ZQGkm0wkEzrCPbh/edit?gid=1041787491#gid=1041787491) .

We also have ~~12~~ 11 powers who are Government in Exiles! Aka alive (at 1 SC) but outside of their starting SCs.
- Akwa'ala -> Yokuts
- Amazon -> Madeira
- Freiburg -> Venice
- ~~Jamestown -> Catawba~~
- Mahra -> Rustaq
- Phan Rang -> Hanoi
- Quebec -> Tadoussac
- ~~Tbilisi -> Trebizond~~
- Tripoli -> Tunis
- Tunis -> Tripoli
- Venice -> Florence
- Ville Marie -> Quebec
- Yokuts -> Akwa'ala

Finally, thanks to the dedicated work of `@[Krasnoyarsk] Autumn Bestie` we have timezones for 276 out of 301 players! Only 25 more to go! üéâ
